### E‑bike Support AI Agent
**Description:**

After‑sales support arrived via multiple channels (Facebook, Zalo, Shopify storefront, and local sales). Agents had to cross‑reference orders, warranties, and messages manually. Response times were inconsistent and context was lost across channels. I provide a chat‑first agent that:
1. handles FAQs and triage with an LLM,
2. creates and updates tickets linked to the customer’s channel (PSID/ID), and
3. looks up orders from Shopify/Lazada/local DB and surfaces the right context to the reply.

**Technologies:**

Go, OpenAI (openai-go/v3), PostgreSQL 16 (+pgvector), Redis 7, Docker Compose, AWS App Runner, EC2, CloudWatch, AWS IAM/Secrets Manager, Facebook Graph API (Messenger), Shopify Admin API.
